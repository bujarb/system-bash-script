This is a Linux system bash script that I wrote. I wrote this script so when I install a fresh Linux distro installation I dont have to type all the commands to install all the things I need for my setup. This bash scripts works only for Debian based Linux distributions. To get this scripts running just navigate to this directory and type "bash system.sh" (without quotes :P)
